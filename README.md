### Hi there 👋

<!--
**BastienGolomer/BastienGolomer** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Greetings! I am Bastien, a MSc graduate in Physics and Data Science from EPFL. 
I am also an enthusiast of software engineering, always interested in learning new things!

## 🔭 Current work
Looking for opportunities to apply machine learning and deep learning methods to interdisciplinary projects.
I have a special interest in MedTech and CleanTech, but my main motivation is to harness these technologies to have a positive impact and help people. 
Sustainability is also a subject very close to my heart and I strive for my work to help society go in this direction.


## 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
Many things at once! I am interested in all sorts of things. 

### ML and DL
* Explore new flavours of machine learning methods

### Software engineering
* System Design
* front-end and back-end
* Dabase systems

### Tools
* Docker
* Azure for Machine learning

Physics related 
* Accelerator physics, there is so much to learn about it. You can do optics, plasma, electrodynamics, solid state physics (for detectors and beam line elements). So cool 🤓
* Particle physics, because the fundamental parts of our universe are a vast mystery ... How exciting!
* I am excited to learn more about how the previous topics can be applied to biomedical devices, for the greater good of people's health!
* Astrophysics and Statistical physics are also wonderful. I should try General Relativity some day though 🤔 ...

Hobbies
* Martial arts & Distance running
* nutrition ("Mens sana in corpore sano")
* hardware-wise, I am interested in audio (PA systems, headphones, etc...) and stage lighting (light shows, DMX programming)
