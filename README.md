Greetings! I am Bastien, a MSc student in Physics and Data Science at EPFL. I am also an enthusiast of software engineering, always interested in learning new things !

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
At the moment, I am finishing my courses at EPFL, but will soon start working on a new exciting project !

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
Many things at once! I'm interested in all sorts of things. 

Tech related
* On my way to being proficient in certain Machine Learning frameworks :smiley: 
* I am trying to learn the basics of software engineering. That's a long road ! I will attempt several mini-projects to fully understand every bit !

Physics related 
* Accelerator physics, there is so much to learn about it. You can do optics, plasma, electrodynamics, solid state physics (for detectors and beam line elements). So cool ðŸ¤“
* Particle physics, because the fundamental parts of our universe are a vast mystery ... How exciting !
* I am excited to learn more about how the previous topics can be applied to biomedical devices, for the greater good of people's health!
* Astrophysics and Statistical physics are also wonderful. I should try General Relativity some day though ðŸ¤” ...

Other things
* nutrition ("Mens sana in corpore sano")
* hardware-wise, I am interested in audio (PA systems, headphones, etc...) and stage lighting (light shows, DMX programming)
